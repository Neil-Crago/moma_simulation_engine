# MOMA Pixels Automaton Example

This example demonstrates how to visualize the **MOMA**-powered cellular automaton in real-time using the `pixels` crate for GPU-accelerated rendering.

It creates a window, initializes a 2D cellular automaton, and then runs a simulation loop where each generation is drawn to the screen as a colorful grid.
