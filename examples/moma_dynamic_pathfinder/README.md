# Example: Dynamic A* Pathfinding with MOMA

This example demonstrates a sophisticated application of the MOMA framework: A* pathfinding on a dynamic, changing map where the cost of traversal is determined by a MOMA function.

It visualizes a pathfinder constantly re-calculating the "path of least resistance" through a chaotic landscape generated by a MOMA cellular automaton. This simulates complex real-world problems like navigating through shifting weather patterns, dynamic energy fields, or volatile markets.

## Concepts Demonstrated

* **Dynamic Pathfinding**: The A* algorithm is run every frame on a map that is constantly evolving.
* **Non-Euclidean Cost Function**: The cost to move from one cell to another is not a fixed distance. Instead, it's calculated in real-time by a `MomaRing` based on the states of the two cells. This creates a complex "cost landscape."
* **Emergent Behavior**: Observe how the optimal path intelligently weaves and re-routes itself to avoid high-cost regions and exploit low-cost channels created by the automaton's patterns.
* **Real-Time Visualization**: Uses the `pixels` crate to provide an immediate, intuitive visual representation of the complex interaction between the automaton and the pathfinder.

## How to Run

First, ensure you have added the necessary dependencies to your `simulation-engine`'s `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
# ... other dependencies
pixels = "0.13.0"
winit = "0.29.0"
```
